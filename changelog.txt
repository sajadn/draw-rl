set a limit for consequent rotations
set a window for rotations
make lines thickers

1 March
Change final reward based on the coverage percents

6 March
Add null action

9 March
move the curser to the right corner

13 March
make convnets smaller (half of original size) ## it didn't work
change coverage cut off to 98 percents

7 April 
decrease input size from 84 to 42
increase batch size from 32 to 64

12April
design shapes to have proper degree --> good result

25 April
change the reward function in a way that repeated lines does not seem that much dangerous because the goal is to draw numbers

1 May add prospective to reward function

11 May readd null action
limit prospect to only 10 pixels forward
give reward of actions after moving on a repeated line for all the repeated line
make the positive reward exponential 

13 May
+make prospect reward exponential
+create reward for moving toward blue points when there is red line to them

15 May
Unsuccessufl try to optimiize environment
which one caused the problem? exponential prospect reward or reward for blue points near red ones tonigh we will test it
